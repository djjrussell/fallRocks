Source code for this can currently be found @https://github.com/djjrussell/fallRocks

Navigate to @https://djjrussell.github.io/fallRocks/ we should see an HTML representation 
of the starting input with two buttons below it, "RUN", and "RESET".

Clicking "RUN", will execute the code and initiate the "gravity"/solution to the problem.

Clicking "RESET" will return the input to its initial state.

One important thing to note, is that if we click "RUN", and we also have the console open, we 
will see each iteration of the problem written to the console as it is being solved.
